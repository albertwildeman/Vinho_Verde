PCA: up=dim reduction, less overfitting, dn=interpretability


- Very unlikely to be linear in any variable, should probably be balanced in most.


3 questions: 
-How can we use this data to predict truly exceptional (or poor) wines? How should we
use this information?
2 answers: to do away with human judges? doesn't make sense? but no transparency req'd
OR: to try to change wine for better. Need interpretability. PCA ok.

- What measurements are important in determining the quality of a wine? How much can
we learn about quality from these measurements? NOT PCA, but lasso. OR PCA different combinations?


-clusters? do hierarchical. And compare clusters between R/W. Do PCA?

First look at distributions of all features!
And maybe
